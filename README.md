# GigaGlobe

Welcome to **GigaGlobe**, a fun and educational game where you control a voracious ball on a mission to grow and dominate! 🍽️⚽

## Game Description:
In **GigaGlobe**, you start as a small ball 🟢. Your goal is to navigate the arena and consume other smaller balls to grow bigger and stronger 💪. The more you eat, the larger you become! 🌐

However, survival isn't just about feasting. If you don't manage to consume anything for a while, you'll begin to shrink back down 😱. And watch out for other players' balls, because if they're bigger, they'll try to eat you! 👀⚠️

Can you master the delicate balance of growth and survival? 🏆 Dive in and find out in **GigaGlobe**!
